## 📌 About The Project

**CineElite** is a full-stack movie ticket booking web application I built as a personal learning project, inspired by platforms like BookMyShow and Fandango. The goal was to go beyond tutorials and build a complete, real-world product end to end — covering everything from browsing movies and trailers, to seat selection, secure payments, automated notifications, and an admin dashboard for managing shows and bookings.

I used this project to learn and practice integrating real third-party services into a MERN application — authentication, payments, webhook verification, and event-driven background jobs — rather than just building CRUD features in isolation.

## ⚙️ Background Jobs (Inngest)

CineElite uses [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) for reliable, event-driven background processing:

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `release-seats-delete-booking` | Runs 10 minutes after seat selection | Checks if payment was completed; if not, releases the held seats back into inventory |
| `send-booking-confirmation-email` | Triggered on successful payment | Sends a confirmation email to the user |
| `send-new-show-notifications` | Triggered when a new show is added | Notifies users of newly released movies |
| `send-show-reminders` | Scheduled ~8 hours before showtime | Sends a reminder email to users with upcoming bookings |

---

## 📧 Email Notifications

Transactional emails are sent using **Nodemailer** with **Brevo** as the SMTP provider:
- ✅ Booking confirmation
- 🎬 New movie release announcements
- ⏰ Showtime reminders (8 hours before the show)

---

## 💳 Payment & Webhook Security

- Payments are processed through **Stripe Checkout**.
- Incoming Stripe webhook events are verified using **Svix** to ensure payloads are authentic and untampered, preventing spoofed payment confirmations.

## 🎓 What I Learned

Building CineElite as a student developer helped me get hands-on experience with:
- Integrating third-party authentication (Clerk) into a full-stack app instead of building auth from scratch
- Handling asynchronous, event-driven background jobs (Inngest) for tasks like delayed seat release and scheduled emails
- Working with real payment infrastructure (Stripe) and verifying webhook authenticity (Svix)
- Consuming and structuring data from a public REST API (TMDB) inside a MongoDB schema
- Sending transactional emails through an SMTP provider (Brevo) via Nodemailer
- Debugging real production issues — including flaky third-party network calls — beyond typical tutorial-level problems

This project is still evolving as I keep learning — feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
